# job-finder

A small tool for finding remote jobs for Clojure, but could be adapted for other
languages.  Basically works by scraping a company list, then looking for the 'jobs'
page on each company site, then seeing if that page contains e.g. 'remote'.
The search results can be returned as a data structure organized by whether
the company site was found, whether it had a 'jobs' page, and whether the 'jobs'
page had 'remote'.
